## Install
This user script can be installed at [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/532680-endless-google-scholar).

If you never used a user script before, they are lightweight browser extensions that help you customize your web experience. See [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) and get started by installing a user script manager for your browser.

Special thanks: this script is derived from [Endless Google](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/tumpio/Endless_Google) by tumpio, which provides similar experience for Google search (not scholar).
